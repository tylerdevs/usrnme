# URL List And Feature Requests

- The URL list is managed in a database and is constantly being updated to account for changes in web sites, and any adjustments that may need to be made to the test strings.

- I try to test as regularly as possible for false positive matches, errors etc. but as the list grows it can be time consuming to track them all down. That being said the list is fairly accurate at the moment. **If you notice a false positive match please let me know.**
- I am going to be regularly pushing updates to the JSON file included in usrnme. If you have URLs or websites you would like added or other requests, let me know ;)
